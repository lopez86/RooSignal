This package can be built with cmake. Currently, it is set up to
work on Linux (built on Ubuntu 14.04 with g++ 4.8.4). Support
for other systems is not provided at the moment but should
be simple.

On Linux, to build:

> mkdir BUILD_DIR
> cd $BUILD_DIR
> cmake $ROOSIGNALDIR/.
> cmake --build .

Install scripts are not yet included, as the package is 
in a very incomplete state.
